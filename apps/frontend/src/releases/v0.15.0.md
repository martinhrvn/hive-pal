# Version v0.15.0 Frame of Mind

**Released:** 2026-02-14

## 🚀 What's New

### Simplified Box Configuration

The box configurator has been streamlined by removing the redundant "Box Type" (variant) dropdown. Frame Size is now the single source of truth — selecting a frame size automatically determines the box variant behind the scenes.

### Smart Frame Size Filtering

When configuring secondary boxes, the frame size dropdown now only shows sizes compatible with the main box's hive system. Custom frame sizes remain available for all configurations.

### Auto-Conversion on System Change

Changing the main box's frame size to a different hive system (e.g., Langstroth to National) automatically converts all secondary boxes to the equivalent frame size in the new system.

### B Hive Frame Sizes

Added built-in B Deep and B Shallow frame sizes to the catalog, completing support for all standard hive systems.

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Cleaner Box Visuals**: Removed redundant variant label from box display — the frame size name already conveys this information
- **Less Confusion**: No more seeing "Custom" in a variant dropdown when it refers to frame size custom options
- **Default Frame Size**: New boxes now start with a matching frame size pre-selected

*This release simplifies box configuration by letting the frame size drive everything. Less dropdowns, fewer decisions, same flexibility. Happy Valentine's Day! 🐝*
