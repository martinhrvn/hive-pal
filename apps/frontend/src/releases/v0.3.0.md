# Version v0.3.0 Hive Health Scores
**Released:** 2025-03-10

Buzzing with excitement for this one! üêù I've been busy as a bee improving how you track and manage your hives. This release brings major queen management features and smarter inspection metrics to help you better understand your hive's health at a glance.
## New in this release:

- Complete queen management system - track markings, colors, and replacement dates
- Smart hive health metrics calculated from your inspections
- Redesigned hive detail page with statistical cards showing key health indicators
- Inspection timeline with toggleable detailed view
- New action sidebar for quick access to common hive management tasks

## Improvements:

- Enhanced observation tracking with clearer labels and hover indicators
- Fixed several typos in observation labels (no more "capped blood" instead of "capped brood"!)
- More responsive layout that works better on different screen sizes
- Improved Docker setup with automatic migrations

Small fixes and big features - all to make your beekeeping experience sweeter than honey!
