# Version v0.9.0 Data Viz & QR Codes
**Released:** 2025-08-30

## ðŸš€ What's New

### QR Code Magic
Print QR codes directly from the app! Added QR code printing functionality with quick sidebar access. Now you can slap a QR code on your hive and scan it later when you can't remember which hive is which.

### Charts & Analytics
Your data deserves better than boring tables. New charts for feeding history and health scores, plus a shiny new analytics tab to make sense of all that bee data you've been collecting.
