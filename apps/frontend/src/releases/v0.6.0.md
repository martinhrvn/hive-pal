# Version  v0.4.0 The Apiary Overhaul
**Released:** 2025-03-10

This release adds several new features for action management, weather integration, and hive positioning. No bees were harmed in the making of this software update.

## New in this release:

* **Standalone Action Management**:
  * Create and track actions independently of inspections
  * Enhanced action filtering by date with improved type safety
  * Flexible hive associations for apiary-wide activities

* **Weather Integration & Scheduling**:
  * Schedule inspections with integrated weather forecasts (because nobody likes getting caught in the rain with angry bees)
  * Adjustable timeline view with visual status badges
  * Weather data collection and historical tracking

* **Interactive Hive Positioning**:
  * Drag-and-drop hive layout matching your physical setup
  * Visual apiary mapping for better organization (finally, your digital hives can match the chaos of real life)

## Improvements:

* **User Experience**: Improved inspection form handling, streamlined data fetching, and cleaner code organization
* **Data Management**: Enhanced database schema with flexible action models and automated weather scheduling
* **Infrastructure**: Updated dependencies, enhanced API endpoints, and improved component architecture

This update adds weather-aware planning capabilities and gives you more flexibility in tracking activities across your apiary. The positioning feature helps keep your digital layout aligned with your physical hive arrangement, assuming you remember where you actually put them.

Happy beekeeping! üçØ
