    - Consolidated TypeScript configurations for better type safety
    - Integrated Turbo for faster, more reliable builds
    - Enhanced error handling and validation throughout the application

This update focuses on making Hive Pal more efficient for managing multiple hives and providing better insights into your apiary health. The batch inspection scheduling feature is particularly useful for beekeepers managing multiple colonies, saving you precious time during the busy season!

I've also made significant improvements under the hood to ensure the application runs smoothly and reliably, with better error handling and data validation throughout.

Happy beekeeping! üçØ
