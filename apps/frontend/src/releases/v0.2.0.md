# Version  v0.2.0 Observations usability
**Released:** 2025-03-09

Honey, I'm home with improvements! 🐝 I've added the ability to edit inspections (because let's face it, mistakes happen). Plus, I've streamlined how you enter observations during inspections - it's now easier to add what you need with as few taps as possible!
## New in this release:

    - Edit inspections after the fact (for when you remember that one queen cell you forgot to note)
    - Simplified observation entry during inspections (because bee time is precious time)
