# Version  v0.4.0 The Apiary Overhaul
**Released:** 2025-03-10

Wow, what a release this is! üêù I've been working overtime to transform Hive Pal from a single-hive tracker into a full-blown apiary management system. This major update introduces multi-user support, apiary management, and a completely redesigned user experience to help you manage all your bee kingdoms from one central hive mind!

### New in this release:

- Complete multi-user system with authentication, registration, and role-based access
- Apiary management - group your hives by location with map-based location picking
- User onboarding wizard to get new beekeepers set up quickly
- Redesigned navigation with breadcrumbs and apiary switcher
- Enhanced mobile support with responsive layouts and mobile detection
- Beautiful new UI components for a more intuitive experience

### Improvements:

- Inspection notes for keeping detailed records of your observations
- Refined metrics calculations for more accurate hive health scoring
- More detailed weather integration in inspection records
- Database performance optimizations with new indexes
- Streamlined sidebar and navigation experience
- Advanced queen management with validation and history tracking
- Docker and deployment improvements for better reliability

I've completely rebuilt how you interact with your hives - now you can manage multiple apiaries and get a better overview of your entire beekeeping operation! Each user manages their own apiaries and hives with secure data separation.
