# Hive Management

Hives are the heart of your beekeeping operation. Hive-Pal helps you track the status, configuration, and history of each hive.

## Creating a Hive

To add a new hive:

1. Navigate to the Hives section in the sidebar, or go to an apiary's detail page
2. Click the "Add Hive" button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Name/Number**: A unique identifier for the hive
   - **Apiary**: Where the hive is located
   - **Status**: Current state of the hive (e.g., active, inactive)
   - **Notes**: Any additional information
4. Click "Save" to create the hive

## Hive Configuration

Hive-Pal allows you to specify the physical configuration of your hive:

- **Box Configuration**: Add and arrange boxes (supers, brood boxes)
- **Frame Count**: Specify how many frames each box contains
- **Queen Information**: Link to the current queen's details

## Hive Status

Track the current state of each hive with these status options:

- **Active**: A normally functioning hive
- **Inactive**: A hive that is not currently in use
- **Problem**: A hive experiencing issues that need attention
- **Dead**: A hive that has died out
- **Archived**: A hive you no longer want to display in your active list

## Hive Details

On the hive details page, you can:

- View the hive's current configuration
- See queen information
- Access the inspection history
- View hive statistics
- Add new inspections

## Managing Hives

From the hives list view, you can:

- **Filter** hives by apiary or status
- **Sort** hives by various criteria
- **Search** for specific hives
- **Quickly update** hive statuses

## Best Practices

- **Consistent naming**: Develop a consistent naming/numbering system
- **Regular updates**: Keep hive statuses current for accurate record-keeping
- **Configuration tracking**: Update box configurations as you add or remove supers
- **Link queens**: Always associate the correct queen with each hive
- **Notes**: Use the notes field for important information that doesn't fit elsewhere
