## Adding a New Queen

To add a new queen:

1. Navigate to a hive's detail page
2. Click on "Queen Information"
3. Click "Add Queen"
4. Fill in the queen details:
   - **Marking Color**: Standard color code for the year
   - **Source**: Where the queen came from (purchased, bred, swarm, etc.)

   - **Installation Date**: When the queen was introduced to the hive
   - **Status**: Current state of the queen
   - **Notes**: Additional information about the queen

## Queen Status Tracking

Keep track of the queen's status with these options:
