# Queen Management

Track and manage queen information for your hives.

## Adding a New Queen

Currently, you can add a new queen through the hive's side menu:

1. Navigate to a hive's detail page
2. Open the hive side menu
3. Select "Add Queen" option
4. Enter the new queen's information

When you add a new queen, it will automatically replace any existing active queen in that hive.

## Available Features

The current queen management system allows you to record:

- **Marking Color**: Standard color code for the year
- **Source**: Where the queen came from
- **Race/Strain**: Genetic background
- **Installation Date**: When introduced to the hive
- **Notes**: Additional information

## Coming Soon

More comprehensive queen management features are planned for future updates, including:
- Queen performance tracking
- Detailed queen history
- Breeding records
- Queen status management
- Lineage tracking

## Best Practices

- **Color marking**: Use the international color coding system (White-Yellow-Red-Green-Blue)
- **Record keeping**: Document queen source and genetics for future reference
- **Regular updates**: Keep queen information current when changes occur
