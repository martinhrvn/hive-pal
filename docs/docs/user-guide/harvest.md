# Harvest Management

Track and manage honey harvests across multiple hives with proportional yield calculation.

## Starting a Harvest

To begin recording a harvest:

1. Navigate to the main menu
2. Select "Harvest" from the side menu
3. Click "Start Harvest" button
4. Enter the harvest date
5. Select which hives you're harvesting from using checkboxes
6. Input the number of frames you're taking from each selected hive

This creates a **draft harvest entry** that you can edit until you're ready to finalize.

## Recording Yield

After extracting the honey:

1. Open your draft harvest entry
2. Enter the total yield (weight of honey harvested)
3. Review the harvest details
4. Make any necessary adjustments to:
   - Hives included
   - Number of frames per hive
   - Total yield amount

## Finalizing the Harvest

Once you're satisfied with the harvest data:

1. Click "Finalize Harvest"
2. The system automatically:
   - Calculates proportional yield for each hive based on frame count
   - Adds harvest entries to individual hive records
   - Updates the harvest table with the completed harvest

## Proportional Calculation

The yield distribution works as follows:
- Total frames from all hives are counted
- Each hive's percentage is calculated (hive frames รท total frames)
- Yield is distributed proportionally to each hive
- Individual hive records are updated with their share

**Example:** 
- Hive A: 10 frames
- Hive B: 5 frames  
- Total yield: 30kg
- Hive A receives: 20kg (66.7%)
- Hive B receives: 10kg (33.3%)

## Harvest Table

Completed harvests appear in the harvest table showing:
- Harvest date
- Participating hives
- Total frames harvested
- Total yield
- Individual hive contributions

## Best Practices

- **Frame counting**: Be accurate with frame counts for proper yield attribution
- **Draft review**: Take time to review before finalizing
- **Timely recording**: Enter yield data soon after extraction
- **Consistent units**: Use the same weight units across all harvests
