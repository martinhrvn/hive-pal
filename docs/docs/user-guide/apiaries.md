# Apiary Management

An apiary is a location where you keep your beehives. Hive-Pal allows you to manage multiple apiaries, each with its own set of hives.

## Creating an Apiary

To create a new apiary:

1. Navigate to the Apiaries section in the sidebar
2. Click the "Add Apiary" button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for your apiary
   - **Location**: Where the apiary is situated
   - **Notes**: Any additional information about the apiary
4. Click "Save" to create the apiary

## Managing Apiaries

From the apiaries list view, you can:

- **View** an apiary's details by clicking on its name
- **Edit** an apiary by clicking the edit button
- **Delete** an apiary by clicking the delete button

## Apiary Details

On the apiary details page, you can:

- See all hives located in this apiary
- View the apiary's location on a map
- Add new hives to the apiary
- Edit apiary information

## Best Practices

- **Name apiaries clearly**: Use names that identify the location (e.g., "Home Yard", "Farm East")
- **Record coordinates**: For apiaries in remote locations, accurate GPS coordinates help you find them again
- **Note nearby resources**: Document water sources and primary nectar plants around the apiary
- **Record land ownership**: If the apiary is on someone else's property, note contact information and any agreements
