# Inspection Management

Regular hive inspections are essential for successful beekeeping. Hive-Pal makes it easy to record detailed observations during each inspection.

## Creating an Inspection

To record a new inspection:

1. Navigate to a hive's detail page
2. Click the "Add Inspection" button
3. Fill in the inspection details:
   - **Date**: When the inspection was performed
   - **Weather conditions**: Temperature and general conditions
   - **Observations**: What you observed (see below)
   - **Notes**: Any additional comments or action items

## Recording Observations

Hive-Pal allows you to record various observations during an inspection:

- **Queen Sighting**: Whether you saw the queen
- **Eggs Present**: Indicates recent queen activity
- **Larvae Present**: Health of the brood cycle
- **Capped Brood**: Indicates ongoing reproduction
- **Queen Cells**: Potential swarming or supersedure
- **Disease Signs**: Any indications of disease
- **Varroa Mites**: Presence and level of mites
- **Honey Stores**: Amount of honey in the hive
- **Temperament**: Behavior of the colony
- **Population**: Size of the colony

Each observation can be rated to indicate the severity or quantity.

## Inspection Timeline

On the hive details page, you can view a chronological timeline of all inspections, making it easy to track changes over time.

## Inspection Analysis

Hive-Pal helps you analyze inspection data by:

- Showing trends over time for key metrics
- Highlighting potential issues based on observation patterns
- Providing a historical record of colony development

## Adding Inspection Notes

For each inspection, you can add detailed notes about:

- Actions taken during the inspection
- Treatments applied
- Future actions needed
- Changes to hive configuration

## Best Practices

- **Regular schedule**: Establish a regular inspection schedule
- **Consistency**: Record the same core observations for each inspection
- **Detail level**: Be specific in your observations (e.g., "3 queen cells on frame 5")
- **Weather impact**: Note weather conditions that might affect bee behavior
- **Action items**: Use notes to record what needs to be done at the next inspection
- **Photos**: Consider taking photos during inspections to document issues
